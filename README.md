# gosexy/exif

A primitive Go binding for [libexif][1].

## How to install

```
go get github.com/gosexy/exif
```

## Usage

Install the package with `go get` and use `import` to include it in your project.

```
import "github.com/gosexy/exif"
```

This is an example on how to read EXIF data from a file:

```
reader := exif.New()

err := reader.Open("_examples/resources/test.jpg")

if err != nil {
  t.Fatalf("Error: %s", err.Error())
}

for key, val := range exif.Tags {
  fmt.Printf("%s: %s\n", key, val)
}
```

There is currently no support for writing EXIF data to images, however if
someone would care to make the effort it would be great.
